#### High Level Overview

XOR Open Loan is a unique open source and completely decentralized system that makes loan contracts that are low cost for borrowers, high return for lenders, and contain end-to-end transparency and immutability on the blockchain. XOR Open Loan removes the middleman by allowing lenders to vet borrowers themselves with a trust system.In addition, because lenders are themselves incentivized to make a maximum return on investment, they are incentivized to make the fee-to-interest ratio on the loan as low as possible. This creates a situation where both parties get the best possible deal. The XOR Open Loan system records all loan contracts on a public ledger on the blockchain. This means that all contracts are guaranteed to be transparent. A transparent open source loan contract allows for the possibility of infinite numbers of derivative markets based on those debt obligations that can be created by anyone with internet access.

#### Challenges

Coming up with mechanisms that ensured true decentralization with stability was a pretty difficult and lengthy process. The mechanisms have to be precise in order to create a system of mutual benefit, a key concept throughout our implementation of XOR Open Loan. In addition, we had trouble debugging with the stack we used (Dharma and Solidity) which also took up a lot of time.
